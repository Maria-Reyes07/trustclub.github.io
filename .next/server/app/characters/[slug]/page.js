    was already baptized, some things happened to me that made me drift away from the LORD; so I became lukewarm. I made a friend my first year 
    in high school, Jeremiah Tech. We were inseparable until we went our separate ways after high school because of college. I kind of had a 
    crush on him but we are not going to talk more on that. Anyways at 20, the LORD called my name, and I answered. I decided to turn from my 
    old ways and become new, but it wasn’t easy. ummm I was bitter, angry, and suicidal, and I was always rejected. I felt like I wasn’t capable 
    of doing anything. At 22, I started to go to church to get my teachings in and grow closer to the LORD. At 25, my pastor decided to do an 
    unplanned baptism after the sermon, and I felt moved. On that day my pastor preached about the Holy Spirit and wanting all of Him. I stood 
    up with the desire to receive the Holy Spirit, and people came up to me, and started praying for me, and delivered me from what I mentioned 
    earlier. At that moment, I burst into tears. I hadn't cried in such a long time, and it was almost like my emotions were unlocked by the 
    Holy Spirit. And it felt great! I felt like I was carrying so much and it was taken right off of me.

    Every time I turned around, she was there harassing me. Nah, I'm just kidding, but we were good friends. After high school, I would think of 
    her now and then. Uhh, I was struggling with the spirit of Jezabel, rejection, and gluttony. I was also insecure about how my body looked. 
    I thought I wouldn’t get married and was okay with that. My mindset was only on fulfilling my dream, which was to become a professional NBA

And that's the camera I'm supposed to look at, right? Okay. So...hi. 
    This is awkward, but my name is Robin Baker. Um, before I met the Lord, I was. Ya know.. wronged by many people. Especially men. I had the 
    mindset of "I don't need no man." You see, most of the men I was with weren't even that good in bed, so it was like, what's the whole point? 
    After that, I got my own “things” to replace those men.... let's just say, “things” to satisfy me in ways they couldn't. So I was okay with 
    that. I made up my mind that I don't need or want a man and never will. Until one day, the Lord called me by my name three times, and I 
    answered and said, "Yes, Lord." He then told me what I needed to do. and I did it. I destroyed everything of my past to follow Him, especially 
    my “things”. I became a new woman that day. I got my room in order, my mindset was forever made new. The next day, I was at work and met a 
    new guy named Kai. When I first met him, I thought he was kinda annoying..actually, a lot of annoying. But I felt bad for him. You know he 
    was scrawny, and many people didn't like him, so out of pity. I became his friend 'cause I felt bad for him, and I know if it were me, I 
    wouldn't wanna be done like that, right?! So that's our story. Eventually, the annoying, scrawny man became my less annoying, slightly less 
    scrawny husband. He wouldn't stop bothering me, and I went along with cause, why not? Over time, he grew on me. We became friends, and he 
    eventually asked me on a date. I said, "Sure, why not." who's gonna pass up free food, ya know? He treated me very well on that date, and he 
    was like no one I had ever met. On that date, I began to see his love for the Lord. That's all we talked about that day. We started doing 
    bible studies and going out more. He asked me to marry him shortly after that, and I was like, "Sure, I'll marry you!" since then, we have 
    been learning to love each other and keep the Lord in our marriage. Despite my past, the Lord has truly healed me; in my marriage, we 
    communicate and are open and honest with each other. Before I go, just be prepared for him to tell you that I loved him first and was head 
    over heels for him....I was not...he says that as a joke, but hopefully, the Holy Spirit convicts him when he tells the story.`,confessionalImage:"/characters/robin-placeholder.png"},{name:"Kai Baker",slug:"kai-baker",favoriteColor:"black",profilePic:"/characters/kai-placeholder.png",verse:`11\xa0For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the\xa0Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.`,nickname:"N/A",age:"25",gender:"Male",job:"Head Wrangler",height:"6'2\"",eyeColor:"Black",hairColor:"Black",likes:"- Animals, Play pool, Hiking, Rodeo, Rugby, Black",dislikes:"Psychic readings, getting lost",hobbies:"Horeseback riding, Baking",personalityType:"ESFP",loveLanguage:"Physical Touch",petPeeves:"Animal abuse & Leaving dishes in the sink",weapons:[{name:"Pistol",description:"use for close-range combat"},{name:"Rifle",description:"a balance of range, damage, and rate of fire, making them versatile in various situations.
