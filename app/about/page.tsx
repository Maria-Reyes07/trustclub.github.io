        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is to create powerful, immersive games that lead both believers and unbelievers to the truth of the Father, Son, and 
            Holy Spirit. Through bold storytelling, spiritual symbolism, and Holy Spirit-led creativity, we shine light in dark placesâ€”equipping 
            players to encounter God, face spiritual realities, and walk in divine purpose.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          What started as a small passion project has blossomed into a growing 
          community of dreamers and believers. Every pixel, every line of dialogue, 
          and every melody is crafted with love and intention.
